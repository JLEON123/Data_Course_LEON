FacultySalaries_1995.csv   # College faculty salaries and total compensation from 1995, by Ranks, Tier, and State (This is supposedly real data, but I'm not sure the scale. 600 definitely doesn't mean $600,000, but it's not important.) College faculty have 3 ranks: Assistant (not tenured), Associate (tenured), and Full (been around forever or something). College "Tier" refers to the amount of funding devoted to research vs the amount of funding for teaching, with Tier I being universities that spend more on research than teaching and award PhD degrees.

Juniper_Oils.csv #Real data collected as part of a collaboration between Young Living Inc. and UVU Microbiology. A number of dead cedar 
trees were collected and the chemical composition of their essential oil content was measured. The hypothesis was that certain chemicals would degrade over time since they died in fires. So there are a bunch of columns for chemical compounds, and a column for "YearsSinceBurn." The values under each chemical are Mass-Spec concentrations.
